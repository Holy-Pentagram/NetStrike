WARNING: BY PROCEEDING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT FULL RESPONSABILITY FOR THE USE OF NETSTRIKE!!!

# HOW TO USE ‚ùì

First thing first, I am happy to announce that I made this tool completely easy to use and that by implementing automatic installations and change it to binary automaticcally, and all you user have to do is followe these steps no matter what is your operating system, the program support Linux and Windows for now but just write a comments in this repository and I would be happy tol add it !!!!
# Step 0:
install requirements:
```bash
pip install colorama
```

# Step 1:
```bash
curl -o installer.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Holy-Pentagram/NetStrike/refs/heads/main/installer.py
```

# Step 2:
```bash
python3 installer.py
```

# Step 3:
Now because of the automation you can just run my tool wherever you are on your terminal using the command netstrike.
exemple: netstrike <protocol> <duration (optional)> <IP_address>
additionaly, you can use the command 'netstrike -h' or 'netstrike --help' to learn how to use the tool

THANK YOU!!!

# Bonus:
For my fellas CURRIOUS RESPNSIBLE hackers, to add a layer of security:

    .Use a VPN or VPS (remote server) to hide real IP
    .Use IP spoofing (works only with UDP floods)
    .Launch attacks from public Wi-Fi or open networks
    .Use a live Linux USB (e.g., Tails) to avoid leaving local traces
    .Change MAC address to avoid LAN-based tracking
    .Use a virtual machine and delete it after attack
    .Use throwaway accounts to rent servers
    .Avoid using proxychains/Tor (too slow for DoS)
    .Limit attack duration to avoid being flagged quickly
    .Use encrypted DNS (DoH/DoT) to hide DNS queries
    .Disable logging and clear logs if attacking from a compromised system
    .Avoid attacking well-protected targets (e.g., behind Cloudflare)
    .Blend attack traffic with normal traffic to avoid detection
    .Use non-standard ports or protocols to evade firewalls, because modern firewalls would block sensitive ports
